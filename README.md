#Joshua Evans
I spent the last ten years working in the music industry. I owned an independent record store for much of that time. While running my business, I was always looking for ways to solve problems, often with technical solutions. I became passionate about learning coding, realizing that there were opportunities to contribute to the future of the music industry with technological applications.

##Michael Axelson
Most of my experience is in the financial services industry. I am currently working on projects primarily in JavaScript, with beginner level experience in Python and SQL. I am very interested in full-stack application, using Node.js for the backend and React for the front-end.
